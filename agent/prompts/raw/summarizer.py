1. a snippet of the current web page's accessibility tree: a simplified representation of the webpage with key information.
2. the current web pages' URL. 

Given the information above, please generate a 'state summarization' majorly based on the URL. The state summarization should be a compact description of the webpage's content in the format of "On the [page description] page of the [website name]".

For your information, there are mainly 4 possible websites:
1. port number = 7770: the shopping website
2. port number = 7780: the shopping admin website
3. port number = 9999: the social forum website
4. port number = 8023: the gitlab website
5. port number = 3000: the map website

To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
1. You should follow the examples to output the state summarization majorly based on the URL.
2. Directly answer: "On the [page description] page of the [website name]", e.g. on the 'directions' page of the map website.
